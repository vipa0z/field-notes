## Fuzzing Server Files
it would be helpful to know where such files exist and whether we can read them. Such files include: `Server webroot path`, `server configurations file`, and `server logs`.

#### Server Webroot
We may need to know the full server webroot path to complete our exploitation in some cases. For example, if we wanted to locate a file we uploaded, but we cannot reach its `/uploads` directory through relative paths (e.g. `../../uploads`). In such cases, we may need to figure out the server webroot path so that we can locate our uploaded files through absolute paths instead of relative paths.

 we can fuzz for the `index.php` file through common webroot paths, which we can find in this [wordlist for Linux](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt) 
 ```
var/www/html/
var/www/
var/www/sites/
var/www/public/
var/www/public_html/
var/www/html/default/
srv/www/
srv/www/html/
srv/www/sites/
home/www/
home/httpd/
home/$USER/public_html/
home/$USER/www/
 ```
 
 or this [wordlist for Windows](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-windows.txt).
 ```
 c:\inetpub\wwwroot\
c:\xampp\htdocs\
c:\wamp\www
``` 
Depending on our LFI situation, we may need to add a few back directories (e.g. `../../../../`), and then add our `index.php` afterwords.
