## Remote Management Services for Windows

 test if user can winrm
 ```
 nxc winrm ip -u user -p pass
 
 # look for PWNED! If it says pwned that means u can winrm into the box
 ```

WinRM uses (`SOAP`) Protocol  to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications. Therefore, WinRM must be explicitly enabled and configured starting with Windows 10.  

Services like remote sessions using PowerShell and event log merging require WinRM.
Another component that fits WinRM for administration is
(`WinRS`), which lets us execute arbitrary commands on the remote system.


```shell
$ nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p5985,5986 --disable-arp-ping -n

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
5985/tcp open  http    Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)
_http-title: Not Found
|_http-server-header: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
```

Powershell session with creds using evil-winrm
```
evil-winrm  -u <acc-name> -p <pw> -i <ip>
```
evil-winrm domain account + nt
```
evil-winrm -ip DC01IP -u user@fqdn -p pass
example:

evil-winrm -ip DC01IP -u sflowers@inlanefreight.local -H nthash
```

If we want to find out whether one or more remote servers can be reached via WinRM, we can easily do this with the help of PowerShell. The [Test-WsMan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.wsman.management/test-wsman?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is responsible for this, and the host's name in question is passed to it. In Linux-based environments, we can use the tool called [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm), another penetration testing tool designed to interact with WinRM.
