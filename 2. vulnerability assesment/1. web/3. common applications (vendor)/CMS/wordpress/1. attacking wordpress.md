## Some notes that might help you

WordPress stores its plugins in the `wp-content/plugins` directory. This folder is helpful to enumerate vulnerable plugins. Themes are stored in the `wp-content/themes` directory. These files should be carefully enumerated as they may lead to RCE.


# AUTHORIZATION LEVELS
There are five types of users on a standard WordPress installation.

1. Administrator: This user has access to administrative features within the website. This includes adding and deleting users and posts, as well as editing source code.
2. Editor: An editor can publish and manage posts, including the posts of other users.
3. Author: They can publish and manage their own posts.
4. Contributor: These users can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.
5. Subscriber: These are standard users who can browse posts and edit their profiles.
